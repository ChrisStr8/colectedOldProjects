1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did

you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
the frogs were going partly over the right and bottom walls. To fix the bug I subtraced the frog's size from the wall when checking if the frog had reached the wall  

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
using the colour picker to set colours was similar to the tricolor flag program. I did this in the same way as in tricolor flag program by using UI.setColor()

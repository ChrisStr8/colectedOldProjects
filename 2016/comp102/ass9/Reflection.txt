Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?
I completed all the questions because I had time to do them, and decided I should.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
when rotating my image 180 degrees, I found that my code only moved the top and bottom
quartres were moved. This was because I was only going through half the height and 
width of the aray. I fixed the code to go through the whole aray. I also had to change the
code for rotating the image to make it work.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
iterating through the image arays was similar to the domino game in the last assingment.
The dificulty was about the same as the domino game, although it required nested for 
loops because it was a 2d aray.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
no other thoughts.

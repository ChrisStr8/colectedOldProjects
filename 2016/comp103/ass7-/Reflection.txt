For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?


* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.

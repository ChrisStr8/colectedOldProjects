If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they? 


The Java collection library provides several different implementations of the
Set type, including HashSet and TreeSet. Why does it not provide ArraySet?
After all, Java provides the ArrayList implementation of the List type!

ArraySet would take O(n) time to search because it is unordered. There is no reason to 
use ArraySet rather than hash or tree set.

For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

I finished core, completion and challenge.
When I switched the completion boolean in SlideshowApp to true my add before and after methods stooped working correctly.
I worked out that this error was coming from the next method in the inerator and I was then able to fix it.


* Do you think that having both classes "Images" and "ImageNode" is overkill? 
  What pros and cons can you think of in comparison to just using ImageNode?


* Did you notice the different complexity of adding an image
  before vs after the cursor? 
  What are the complexities and what is the cause of this complexity difference?

It was necessary to run through the list from the header to find the previous node, only then could the new node could be added. 

* Can you think of an extension to "ImageNode" that would avoid the 
  above mentioned complexity difference? 

You could have the image nodes store a reference to the node before them. 

* Cursors are a good way of obtaining quick access to a certain point in a list. 
  Can you think of a potential problem if a client does not use Images.setCursor correctly?

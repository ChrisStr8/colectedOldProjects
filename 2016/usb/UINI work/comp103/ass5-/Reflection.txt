For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
espectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

Sometimes a recursive method can alternatively be written just using simple
loops. What do think determines whether this is possible or not? 
this is always posible but it is to always pratical.

What are the advantages/disadvantages of using recursive methods rather than
loops?

Many people find recursion hard to understand at first, although it doesn't do
anything different from previous programs - it just involves methods which call
methods.  Why is it tricky then?

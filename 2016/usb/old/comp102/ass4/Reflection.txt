Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?
no

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
in the pattern patterns drawer chalange I was un able to get the new circles centered in the previous circles.
this is probaly due to the x and y cordinits seting the corner of a square in which the circle is drawn, rather
than the circles center.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

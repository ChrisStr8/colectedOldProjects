Briefly describe your scheme for representing the state of the board.
Was it efficient in file size?
  If so, explain why.
     Would it still be efficient when there were 100 tiles on the board? 
  If not, explain why not and suggest a more efficient scheme.

Explain how run-length coding could reduce the size of the 
pbm image below.  What sorts of images would it work badly on? Is it
possible to make a compression scheme that could reduce the size of any possible
image?

if run-length encoding was used on the pbm it would be

10B
1B8W1B
1B8W1B
1B5W4B
1B4W5B
1B3W6B
1B8W1B
1B1W1B1W1B1W1B1W2B

run-length encoding works well on images with long runs of a single colour 
if the image was entirely single pixel runs then run-length encoding would not 
work to compres it.

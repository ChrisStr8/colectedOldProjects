Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1.  What is the advantage of making a DodgemCar class?  Why is it better
than putting all the code in a single DodgemGame class, like we did
with the floorCleaner in Assignment 1?

Havimg a seprate class means that you can have multiple instances, without having to duplicate the code. 

2. The assignment split the development of both programs into three
stages (Core, Completion, and Challenge).  This was partly for
marking, but it was also intended to make it easier to do the
program.  Why does it it help to have several stages? What Software Engineering
methodology does this reflect?

Having several seprate stages is similar to the waterfall methodology. Having multiple stages breaks up 
the work load, this makes each stage easy compared to the full assingment.

3. Last week you constructed a list of the key Java programming
constructs that you used.  Add the important new constructs you used
this week to that list, with a very brief note about each one.



4. If you learned any more important concepts about programming or Computer
Science, add them to your list from last week.
